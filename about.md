This data dashboard and mobile application, FeedFinder are part of an ongoing Digital Civics research project at Newcastle University. 

FeedFinder is a free mobile app used by over 12000 women world-wide to find, rate and review places based on how breastfeeding friendly they are. 

Over the last three years researchers have been working in collaboration with local breastfeeding mothers, public health improvement practitioners and infant feeding coordinators in the North East of England to improve breastfeeding support in our local communities. 

You can explore the breastfeeding and public health profile of your local area using the data provided from FeedFinder and Public Health.
