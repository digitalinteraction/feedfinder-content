# About

This data dashboard is part of an ongoing Digital Civics research project funded by EPSRC at Newcastle University. 

Weâ€™ve co-designed and built FeedFinder and this data dashboard as part of a collaborate research project with breastfeeding mothers, public health practitioners, infant feeding co-ordinators and local public facing organisations in Newcastle. This resource may be of interest to parents, policy officials and other stakeholders to make local and national comparisons and to develop targeted breastfeeding support services. In time, the resource will enable the monitoring of quality and effectiveness of services.


If you have any questions about the research project then please contact:
