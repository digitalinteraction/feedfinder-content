# About

This data dashboard is part of an ongoing [Digital Civics](https://digitalcivics.io/) research project funded by [EPSRC](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/L016176/1) at Newcastle University. 

We’ve designed and built FeedFinder and this data dashboard as part of a collaborate research project with breastfeeding mothers, public health practitioners, infant feeding co-ordinators and local public facing organisations in Newcastle. This resource may be of interest to parents, policy officials and other stakeholders to make local and national comparisons and to develop targeted breastfeeding support services. In time, the resource will enable the monitoring of quality and effectiveness of services.

If you have any questions about the research project then please contact:

### Breastfeeding

Increasing breastfeeding rates is a key public health priority in the UK and providing support in the local community can make new parents feel much more confident, as well as giving their babies the best start in life. 
We know a lot of women stop breastfeeding before they want to and some women don’t initiate breastfeeding for fear of being unsupported in public. We listened to women and have co-developed this resource, including a free downloadable policy to provide support for the local community in becoming more breastfeeding friendly. 

### What is the law?

Women are protected to breastfeed anywhere they want under the Equality Act 2010 . The Equality Act describes it as sex discrimination if a woman is treated unfavourably. A woman should not be asked to stop breastfeeding, and if she is, she can complain to the Government Equalities Office and file a claim for discrimination.

### What is FeedFinder?

FeedFinder is a free mobile application developed with breastfeeding mothers to provide them with an easy way to find and share suitable places to breastfeed when out in public. Women are able to find, rate and review places based on how breastfeeding friendly they are. Since the launch, the app has been used by over 12,000 women who have reviewed over 5000 venues. Some of the reviews have been analysed and contributed to the development of this resource. 

### Why do we need a resource like this?

In the UK, we have some of the lowest breastfeeding rates seen across the world . Yet, the benefits of breastfeeding are widely acknowledged for mother and baby. For example, increasing breastfeeding rates could cut the occurrence of common childhood illnesses such as ear, chest and digestive infections while saving the NHS up to £50 million each year. The [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/) recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first 6 months, followed by complimentary foods until an infant is at least two years old . Breastfeeding initiation has increased in recent years but the number of women who continue to breastfeed for the recommended duration are very low and increasing the number of women breastfeeding continues to be a public health priority. The most recent figures from Public Health England for breastfeeding in 2018 have indicated a decline at the 6-8week check-up compared with previous years. 

Unfortunately, we live in a society that sometimes makes it difficult for women who want to breastfeed. The perceived lack of support from the general public means a lot of women choose not to breastfeed at all, or when they do, they choose to stay home to avoid any unwanted attention. We wanted to develop this free resource to show the local community how they can support women when they are breastfeeding, from a warm smile to a free glass of water – your behaviour can have a positive impact on a woman’s experience when she is breastfeeding – and it may even help women to breastfeed for longer. By sharing this free resource, we want women to know they are supported by their local community. 

### How was this data dashboard and policy developed? 

Our collaborative approach involved a combination of different methods with the aim of including as many voices as possible. To begin with, we analysed the text reviews from FeedFinder to develop a list of factors that were considered important when meeting women’s breastfeeding needs. 
We conducted interviews, online consultations, meetings, observations and workshops with parents, infant feeding coordinators, and public health practitioners. 

FeedFinder reviews were used to guide the initial development of the policy and data dashboard and women were invited to comment and provide feedback. An online survey through social media captured opinions on breastfeeding in public from 250 women.
