# Our Breastfeeding Policy

By adopting this policy, we, [organisation name- this will be a blank space] agree
to the following principles to support women breastfeeding.

- _We will be welcoming of breastfeeding mothers._
    Breastfeeding women need to be reassured that it is widely accepted and
    welcome to breastfeed anywhere. A look is important and can say 1000 words, if
    you happen to catch their eye, don’t stare but give a little smile and she will feel
    at ease.
- _We will not allow any other member of the public to discriminate_
    _against breastfeeding women._
    It is against the law to discriminate a woman breastfeeding. Women are protected
    under the Equality Act 2010 to breastfeed anywhere in a public place. A person
    who discrimates a breastfeeding mother may be prosecuted.
- _We will ensure our staff are friendly and polite towards breastfeeding_
    _mothers and their children._
    Breastfeeding women are often nervous and fearful of the public’s
    reaction to breastfeeding, it is important that women are made to feel
    welcome.
- _We will ensure that our staff are helpful and provide table service_
    _whenever possible to breastfeeding women._
    A breastfeeding woman might be sitting in the same place for a long
    time while her baby feeds. By offering table service, this can provide a
    better experience for women.
- _We will provide free drinking water._
    Breastfeeding is thirsty work! Providing free drinking water can make
    sure a woman is kept hydrated while nursing her baby.
- _Changing facilities will provide a changing mat (at least) or changing_
    _table and a waste bin for dirty nappies._
    Babies often need their nappy changed after feeding, providing
    changing facilities will enable this to happen comfortably.
- _We will ensure our changing facilities are kept clean and checked on a_
    _regular basis. Feedback from women suggest unhygienic changing facilities
    negatively impact their breastfeeding experience.
- _All new employees will be provided with adequate training on how to_
    _support breastfeeding mothers and their children._
    In addition to this policy, the website contains a short video from our
    local women on how they want to be supported, watch it here [insert
    URL]. All new staff will watch the video as well as reading this
    document.

If possible in our venue:

- _We will provide a private area for women to breastfeed._
    Some women prefer more privacy than others when breastfeeding
    and would prefer to breastfeed in a designated area.
