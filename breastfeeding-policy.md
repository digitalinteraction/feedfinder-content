### Our Breastfeeding Policy
By adopting this policy, we, __________________ agree to the following principles to support women breastfeeding.
1. We will be welcoming of  breastfeeding mothers. Breastfeeding women need to be reassured that it is widely accepted and welcome to breastfeed anywhere. A look is important and can say 1000 words, if you happen to catch their eye, don’t stare but give a little smile and she will feel at ease.
2. We will not allow any other member of the public to discriminate against breastfeeding women.It is against the law to discriminate a woman breastfeeding. Women are protected under the Equality Act 2010 to breastfeed anywhere in a public place. A person who discrimates a breastfeeding mother may be prosecuted. 
3. We will ensure our staff are friendly and polite towards breastfeeding mothers and their children.Breastfeeding women are often nervous and fearful of the public’s reaction to breastfeeding, it is important that women are made to feel welcome. 
4. We will ensure that our staff are helpful and provide table service whenever possible to breastfeeding women. A breastfeeding woman might be sitting in the same place for a long time while her baby feeds. By offering table service, this can provide a better experience for women.
5. We will provide free drinking water. Breastfeeding is thirsty work! Providing free drinking water can make sure a woman is kept hydrated while nursing her baby. 
6. Changing facilities will provide a changing mat (at least) or changing table and a waste bin for dirty nappies. Babies often need their nappy changed after feeding, providing changing facilities will enable this to happen comfortably.
7. We will ensure our changing facilities are kept clean and checked on a regular basis. Feedback from women suggest unhygienic changing facilities negatively impact their breastfeeding experience.
8. All new employees will be provided with adequate training on how to support breastfeeding mothers and their children.
9. If possible in our venue: We will provide a private area for women to breastfeed. Some women prefer more privacy than others when breastfeeding and would prefer to breastfeed in a designated area.

In addition to this policy, the website contains a short video on how they want to be supported, watch it below.
All new staff will watch the video as well as reading this document.

This policy will be reviewed routinely every year to ensure all staff are up to date.

The staff member responsible for the implementation of this policy to all staff is __________________________________.
